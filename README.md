# My Portfolio Site using Lume

I want to have a portfolio site and I want to do something new so seems [lume](https://lume.land/) is something interesting to do.

So here we are, this is my attemp to learn Lume and hopefully can deploy it to Github pages.

- install `deno`
- install `lume` cli [here](https://lume.land/docs/overview/command-line/)
- source files located in `src`
- generated files located in `dest` (created when execute `lume -s`)
