                            Hi &#128075;, I'm Hery Sehastian, a web developer with over ten years of experience in the
                            tech industry. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with various
                            companies and holding different positions within diverse teams.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of my 12-year journey, I've worked on numerous projects, utilizing a range
                            of technologies such as Java, Ruby, Go, and JavaScript. However, PHP has always remained my
                            primary programming language, and I've extensively honed my skills in it.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            As I embark on creating this site, I initially contemplated developing a portfolio to
                            showcase my work. However, I realized that designing it from scratch would consume a
                            significant amount of time. Therefore, I've decided to combine it with a blog where I can
                            share my learnings and experiences. Although I'm uncertain about the frequency of my
                            writing, I'm excited to document my journey and provide valuable insights along the way.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Join me as I delve into the world of web development, share my knowledge, and explore
                            exciting new technologies. I hope you find my content informative, engaging, and perhaps
                            even inspiring.
