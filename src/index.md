## **Hello there!** &#128075;

<br>
Hi, I'm Hery Sehastian, a software engineer with over ten years of professional experience in the tech industry.
<br><br>
Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with various companies and contribute in different roles within diverse teams.
I have also had the opportunity to contribute to numerous projects, where I have gained experience working with a range of technologies including Java, Ruby, Go, and JavaScript. However, my primary focus and expertise lie in maintaining existing projects, with PHP being the language I have predominantly worked with.
<br><br>
Initially, I had the ambition of creating a portfolio website to display my work. However, as I considered the substantial time commitment it would require, I decided to take a simpler approach. Hence, I present to you this plain website, which serves as a platform to share my CV and provide some insights based on my learnings and experiences.
Although I'm uncertain about the frequency of my writing, I'm excited to document my journey and provide valuable insights along the way.
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to our journey together! &#128522;
