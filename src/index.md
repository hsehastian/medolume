## **Hello there!** &#128075;

<br>
Hi, I'm Hery Sehastian, a web developer with over ten years of experience in the tech industry.
<br><br>
Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with various companies and holding different positions within diverse teams. I have also worked on numerous projects, utilizing a range of technologies such as Java, Ruby, Go, and JavaScript. However, PHP has always remained my primary programming language.
<br><br>
Initially, I was planning to build a portfolio website to showcase my work. However, I realized that it would consume a lot of time. So, I decided to just build a simple website where I can put my CV and share my learnings and experiences.
Although I'm uncertain about the frequency of my writing, I'm excited to document my journey and provide valuable insights along the way.
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to our journey together! &#128522;
